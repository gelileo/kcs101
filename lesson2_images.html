    <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>Images are a bit like links. You specify the location of the image with the 'src' property in the <span class="w3-codespan">&lt;img&gt;</span> tag. Note that <span class="w3-codespan">img</span> tags are like <span class="w3-codespan">br</span> tags: they don't come in pairs. The <span class="w3-codespan">alt</span> property should be used to provide a description of the image in case it won't load or the user is partially sighted.</p>

    
  <p>Images can be stored on the same host ... </p>
  <img src="./images/olympics.png" width="200" alt="This should be an image for olympics">

  <p>... or on another server entirely.</p>
  <img src="https://olympics.com/Images/Static/beijing-images/disciplines/olympics/bobsleigh.svg" alt="Winter Olympics - Bob Sleigh.">
